= Building from Source
:jbake-type: page
:jbake-tags: building, source
:jbake-status: published

## Prerequisites

 - If you have an IDE installed such as https://netbeans.org/[NetBeans] or https://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse] installed,
 it will make your development easier.  However, follow on for the brave.

 - At least http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html[JDK 8] is required to compile and run
  the object code.

 - At least https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven 3.3.9] is required to build the source
 files and assemble the project.

## Build Procedure

OpenNLP can either be build from the distributed sources or from
a subversion checkout. These build instructions document how
to build from the latest trunk version. The distributed source package
includes a README file which explains how to build it.

On the first checkout everything should be built.
Go to the opennlp folder inside the trunk folder (e.g. opennlp-trunk) and type 

-----
cd opennlp
mvn install
-----

to build all modules.
The build installs the maven artifacts in the local repository
and creates a binary and source distribution inside the 
opennlp-distr/target folder.

After the initial build the individual modules can be built on their own
with: ``mvn install``

In the opennlp-docs project it is
recommended to always build with ``mvn clean install`` because
changed docbook xml files might not be re-processed otherwise.

In some cases it might be convenient to skip the tests.
That can be done with the ``-Dmaven.test.skip=true``  option.
For example type: ``mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true``

No tests will be executed.

It might happen from time to time that the build fails,
if so please report a broken build on the opennlp-dev mailing
list. The build should always work for everyone.

## Building Language Detection Model

The data used to create the OpenNLP language model is stored in subversion.

To checkout the data:

....
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/bigdata/opennlp/trunk opennlp-corpus
....

To create a tag:

....
svn copy https://svn.apache.org/repos/bigdata/opennlp/trunk https://svn.apache.org/repos/bigdata/opennlp/tags/langdetect-183_RC1 -m "Data used to build Language Detector model 1.8.3"
....

## CI/CD

There are two CI/CD processes for OpenNLP.

* The Jenkins https://builds.apache.org/job/opennlp/[job] builds the OpenNLP artifacts and publishes the snapshot dependencies to Maven Central. 
* The Buildbot https://ci.apache.org/builders/opennlp-site/[job] publishes website changes. The job monitors the https://github.com/apache/opennlp-site[opennlp-site] repository for changes. When changes are found, Buildbot builds the site and pushes it to the asf-site branch. The OpenNLP website will then be updated to the newest revision.
